# Quote App

## TO RUN:
./gradlew run --> quote is displayed in terminal!

## Overview
This app uses Gson to parse a Json file and display a random quote
to the terminal each time the app is run. <br>

Lab 9 update: ./gradlew run now hits an api and returns a star wars quote, which is added
to the JSON file for future reference if the API doesn't work

#### Tests
We wrote a test to verify the constructor in the Quotes Class
